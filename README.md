# Manual-KMeans
My first AI/ML project: recreating the algorithm KMeans. It starts with a random line and then takes the average of the points on top and those on the bottom, creating a new line through those points. It repeats this process until it is sufficiently far away from the data. I still have yet to add functonality for more than 2 classes.
